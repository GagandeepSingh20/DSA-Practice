// Level: Medium-Hard
// Tags: Binary Search, Greedy, Searching

/*
üß† Problem Summary:
You are given positions of `n` stalls and `c` cows.
Place the cows in stalls such that the minimum distance between any two cows is maximized.

Return the largest minimum distance possible.

üìå Example:
Input: stalls = [1, 2, 4, 8, 9], c = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: Place cows at stalls 1, 4, and 8. Min distance = 3.

üõ†Ô∏è Approach:
- Sort the stalls
- Use binary search on answer space (1 to max distance)
- For each mid, check if it's possible to place all cows with that minimum distance
- Greedily place cows in stalls, ensuring the required gap is maintained

üßÆ Time Complexity: O(n log(max_dist))
üßÆ Space Complexity: O(1)
