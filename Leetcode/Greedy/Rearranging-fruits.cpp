// Difficulty: Hard
// Tags: Greedy, Array, HashMap, Sorting

/*
üß† Problem Summary:
You are given two integer arrays `basket1` and `basket2` representing fruits in two baskets.
You can swap any two fruits, one from each basket. The goal is to make both baskets identical
(minimum swaps). Each swap has a cost: minimum of the two swapped fruit values or 
twice the minimum fruit value present in any basket.

Return the minimum total cost to make the baskets equal or -1 if it's not possible.

üìå Example:
Input: basket1 = [4,2,2,2], basket2 = [1,4,1,2]
Output: 1

üõ†Ô∏è Approach:
1. Count the frequency difference of each fruit between the two baskets.
2. If any difference is odd, return -1 (impossible to balance).
3. From the surplus in both baskets, form swap candidates.
4. Sort b1 ascending and b2 descending for optimal swap.
5. Cost is the minimum of direct swap or double the smallest element across both baskets.

üßÆ Time Complexity: O(n log n) for sorting swap candidates.
üßÆ Space Complexity: O(n) for frequency map and swap arrays.
